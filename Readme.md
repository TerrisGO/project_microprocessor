# Face Recognition based Door Lock System Using Raspberry Pi
In this project, we controlled the opening of a door and lighting a light using Raspberry Pi. When Raspberry pi detects a face, then it applies machine learning algorithms to decide it is face of known person or not. The known persons are trained persons which visible in UI and their access in the room can be controlled with checkbox. A person can only enter only if his face is known to the database and the relevant person's permission is granted in the control panel.

## How this system works ?
To know the answer, first let's introduce with the hardware components we are using:
- [x] Raspberry Pi
- [x] Mobile Camera (or any other webcam)
- [x] A servo motor
- [x] Wooden Door
- [x] Electrical Relay
- [x] 220 V Light
-
These are the main component of our project. When a person is permitted to enter, the door opens using servo motor and the light is switched on using relay.
